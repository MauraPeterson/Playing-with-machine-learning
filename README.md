# Playing around with machine learning
I am basically just playing around with machine learning concepts

## IsPixelRed.py
A super simple program to see if a pixel is red using a bad threshold and then use a hard coded array of known bool values for each pixel to update the threshold.

I added a function to create a new image with the flattened red and non red pixels to visualize the ai's output

I ran into a problem when I realized that the ai knows if something is red better than I do, so my supervize learning isnt great lol

I also realized I do not have the patience to go through a bunch of pixels and decide if they are red.
